## Arduino

The sketch will work with many different types and chipset of board. To use an Arduino Uno, make sure to select the correct board in Boards Manager.

The arduino sketches require the Adafruit VL53L0X library. It is included in the root additional-libraries folder. Afternatively, it can be downloaded through the Arduino libraries manager or from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VL53L0X
