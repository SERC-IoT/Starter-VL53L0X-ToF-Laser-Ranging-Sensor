## Arduino

The sketch will work with many different types and chipset of board. To use an Arduino Uno, make sure to select the correct board in Boards Manager.

<!-- #TODO add library info -->
The arduino sketches require the -- -- libraries. They are included in the root additional-libraries folder. Afternatively, they can be downloaded through the Arduino libraries manager or from -- --
